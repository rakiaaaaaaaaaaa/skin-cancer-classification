# Skin Cancer Classification System

A comprehensive deep learning-based system for automated skin cancer detection and classification using convolutional neural networks.

## üî¨ Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end skin cancer classification system that can identify seven different types of skin lesions using deep learning. The system uses transfer learning with EfficientNetB3 architecture trained on the HAM10000 dataset and provides a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions.

## üéØ Key Features

- **7-Class Classification**: Melanoma, Nevus, Seborrheic Keratosis, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Actinic Keratosis, Benign Keratosis, Dermatofibroma
- **Deep Learning Model**: EfficientNetB3 with transfer learning from ImageNet
- **Web Interface**: Modern, responsive UI with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant classification with confidence scores
- **Clinical Focus**: Designed for medical screening and educational purposes

## üìä Dataset

**HAM10000 Dataset**: 10,015 dermatoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions
- Multi-source collection from different institutions
- Ground truth based on histopathology, expert consensus, or confocal microscopy
- Covers the most common skin lesion types in clinical practice
